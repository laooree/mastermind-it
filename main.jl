#= This code will try to guess the sequence provided by the user. It will do so
by using information theory, and trying guesses that maximized the expected
information value, until the correct solution is found.

The game is structured so that the sequence is four-digitis long, with digits
from 0 to 9. 10'000 combinations are therefore possible.

In future versions I'll add arbitrary sequence length.
